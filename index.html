                I’ve worked as a receptionist in a doctor’s surgery, flipped burgers in McDonald’s, worked as a finance officer in financial services utilising the skills I gained achieving my Finance & Accounting BSc… but I’ve felt for a long time that I should know something about coding!  It’s such an enormous, broad field and industry already and it will surely only become more and more pervasive as time goes on.  As we find to ways to innovate (and automate) we find more and more efficient ways of doing things.  Ways of delivering a better product or service for the same or less effort/input than was required before.  The interconnectivity of near enough everything is one of the cornerstones allowing this progression and these innovations to continue on their upward trend… and coding is the cornerstone of that.  I’ve wanted to learn about it for a long time but have never found the time to look into it myself.  Like a small flame burning at the back of my mind, a nagging awareness that I need to put some action in and get with the program(ing)!.  I feel very lucky to have landed a place on the DevelopCoding course here at CodeNation.
