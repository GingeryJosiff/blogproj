                                It was the case, when IT first became affordably implementable in business, that IT’s function was to make our work life easier, faster and cheaper.  Using computers to perform tasks previously requiring large amounts of paper work (that carried with it it’s own inherent problems such as; storage, transport, security, etc) made for great efficiencies to be made in organisation of daily tasks and document storage and sharing.  With the advancement of IT, both hardware and programming development, it became possible for tasks to be performed with less and less human input, meaning; less human error, greater speed, more cost efficiencies and increased predictability.  IT, or “tech” as it is now referred to, has become more than an integrated function of most business.  It has become the medium through which business is done and in many instances it is either the product itself or the means through which the product market functions “impacting customer service, sales, and even business strategies. As a result, organisations are increasingly turning IT into a driving force in all aspects of business” (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2016/07/26/the-changing-role-of-it-in-the-future-of-business/#713a394b525d">reference#1</a>).

                <p class = "answer">           
                        Digital projects are difficult to plan for and manage.  The main reason for this is that it can be hard to identify aspects of a project that are likely to be problematic and take a long time to complete before they have been attempted.  In order to overcome issues like these and successfully deliver a digital project the team must be able to be agile.  By this I mean they must be adaptable to changing circumstances and demands.  A plan with moving pieces needs people to be resilient and resourceful and not ‘give up at the first hurdle’.  Problems that arise may be unforeseen and need dealing with almost ‘on-the-fly’ so good problem-solving skills are essential as well as good listening skills.  It’s important that the design/develop/digital team listen closely to whoever the ‘client’ or intended user of the project’s end product is so that they deliver on the requirements and ensure the project lives up to expectations.  Trello, utilising the kanban planning methodology, can help with this by splitting the project up into manageable identified tasks.  This also helps with attention to detail (although attention to detail remains a required skill to be held within the team), as long as a task has been identified and placed as a card on the Trello board it can’t be forgotten about and fall through the cracks of a large project with numerous diverse demands.
                        Other skills needed include:
                        Copywriting and editing
                        Problem solving
                        Attention to detail

                                A large project can feel insurmountable.  Too many demands on time with diverse requirements make knowing where to start seem a challenge in itself.  Utilising the kanban planning methodology helps with this problem by breaking down the goal into manageable, achievable tasks.  By assigning the tasks I identify to “cards” on <a href = "https://trello.com/b/a428raR1/blogproj">my Trello board</a> I will be able to pick up the ‘next task’ that needs doing and start making a dent into the overall project, one “card” at a time.

                                1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">
                                “IT projects have an unenviable reputation, with projects failing outright or at least failing to live up to expectations” (<a href = "https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/early-risk-assessment-it-projects-8973">reference#7</a>).
                                There are numerous risks that may cause a digital project to fail outright, as with any project, such as; key person dependancy (an integral team member may leave), competition (competitor innovations make your project obsolete before completion), cost risk (the initial cost estimates turn out to undershoot the actual costs which make the project unviable or loss making).
                                Digital projects carry their own specific risks which can also dramatically impact the project too.  For example developers will be working on building the program on the current iteration of the OS.  A new OS release/update could require changes to their programming to make the end product compatible with the upgrade or could even make the project untenable.
                                There is also the view of failure by not living up to expectations.  A main cause of this is a lack of buy-in from key people.  In business the main driver for an innovation can be a specific department and when cooperation is needed cross-department for the project’s success, reluctance from uncommitted directors/managers viewing the project as ‘additional work’ or a ‘vanity project’ can easily cause the project to fail to have the functionality it was designed to have.

                                “The main purpose of technology is to help you do what you do quicker and more efficiently” (<a href = "https://innovationmanagement.se/2018/01/11/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-for-your-startup/">reference#5</a>) so the first thing you need is to know what it is that you do? Or, what it is you are trying to do.  When you have identified the core aims of the project you are undertaking you can identify your requirements from your IT. It may be that you need something that will integrate with current systems, you may need agility to deal with changing scenarios, you might be dealing with sensitive customer information and need especially secure systems and processes.  Taking these identified requirements and marrying them up with the IT solutions that best satisfy them, as well as considering other project constraints such as budget, timescale and functionality, is how I will make the right choice in selecting technology for the job and hopefully mitigate risks that may have occurred further down the line (<a href = "https://medium.com/flowingis/choosing-the-right-technology-for-the-right-project-dda9fa27320f">reference#6</a>).

                                Without knowing my own skills and the capabilities of html and CSS to deliver the initial ideas I had for the website it was difficult to imagine how I could plan to complete the project.  Inputting tasks onto Trello helped me to see where I was up to and what I needed to be focussing on right now rather than worrying about what is to come.  The visualisation of the tasks as ‘cards’ on the Trello board allowed me to order the tasks according to their priority and assign due-dates (with reminders) for pivotal points (i.e. having to have all the written content complete in order to add it to the webpages).
                                “Pushing” my project over to my GitHub repository I have provided a safety net for my project in the form of version control.  If anything were to go wrong with my coding or anything else at my end (i.e. MacBook failure, files overwritten, accidental deletion, etc) I would be able to revert to any previously ‘pushed’ version of my project.  I performed a ‘git push’ at least daily to ensure sufficient version control capability (this was set as a daily Trello card).

                                1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">
                                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a piece of European Union legislation regulating the processing of personal data. Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—including name, ID numbers, locations or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                                GDPR gives users of online services (data subjects) greater control over the processing of their data than they had before GDPR was introduced. Data subjects now have a right to see what of their information is held by company and can restrict the company’s use of it, even prevent them using it altogether. Public authorities have supervisory powers and rights to impose serious sanctions for infringements of GDPR.
                                
                                For digital projects this means that data flows have to bear in mind the principle of data minimisation. The scope of collected data must be only sufficient to the requirements of the intended purposes of their processing and no more.  Similarly the data may only be retained as long as necessary, meaning time stored has to be an accessibly value assigned to data in order to delete when time limits are reached.
                                “[Failure] to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data you store and process, and suffer a data breach, you might be obliged to communicate it …to users affected by the breach. A hit like that is not the best PR and may cost you more than you could possibly imagine—both in terms of user confidence and money.” (<a href = "https://www.monterail.com/blog/introduction-to-gdpr-for-digital-companies">reference#8</a>)

                        Initially my use of Trello was very limited and I didn’t feel was getting much benefit from it.  I changed my approach and applied the kanban methodology correctly.  Once I was utilising Trello as intended it became a good tool to use to plan my project and grew to like it. Visual Studio Code has been easy to use and I wouldn’t be able to suggest any improvement to it.  It’s done all that I’ve needed of it.  Pushing to GitHub did seem a bit of a convoluted process but I think that is down to my inexperience using it rather than any issue with either GitHub or Visual Studio Code.
        
                        Overall I have enjoyed using all the tools for the project.  None have fallen short of what I’ve required from them.

                <p class = "answer">
                        Using Visual Studio Code has been perfect for the project so far.  It has all the functionality needed to deliver the project and works with gitHub providing a version control function giving protection to the project in the form of version recovery if a catastrophic event took place.
                        To help plan the work and review the plan on and on-going basis I have used Trello which has been great.
                        My use of Visual Studio Code has been appropriate for the project.  Using the terminal built into VSCode, regularly pushing my work to my GitHub repository has ensured sufficient version control and provided protection against human error or hardware failure.  Saving all relevant files into the project directory using the uniform naming parameters of no spaces and all lowercase lettering has made it easy to select the intended file within VSC.  When I started using Trello to plan the project the cards I added to my board were broad titles encompassing many tasks.  I thought that using the Trello ‘cards’ as a kind of heading that related to a section of work would keep my Trello board clean, clear and easy to read and manage.  As it turned out it simply meant that my Trello board was not of much use to me.  Reviewing my use of the tool and applying the kanban method properly, I broke down my work into individual tasks and added them as separate cards to my board.  Doing this gave me much better insight into how the work was progressing and what I needed to be doing next.

                        The website has a good appearance.  The layout and colour scheme work well together.  Applying “background-color-blend” in CSS allowed me to make changes to the appearance of the background images, tweaking them to fit better with the rest of the page.  I have kept the code as simple as possible.  One benefit of this is that the website is well displayed across different devices.  There is not so much on it to go wrong.  Saying that, the loading time is noticeably long on mobile devices.

                        Would liked to have had a scrolling lower frame and keep a constant header section/nav.bar to improve the general navigation and understandability of the site.

                        In order to reduce the loading time the information could be spread across more pages.  More pages with less information and shorter page load times would improve the UX of the site.  Another UX improvement that could be made would be to make the navigation bar a constant element across the top of the page and have the content pages appear within a frame below the navigation bar.  Doing this would improve appearance continuity when navigating through the site and improve general understandability of the site and of the information displayed within it.
Were the page to be used for business purposes it would need to comply with legal requirements and display company information and contact details somewhere.  A footer could be added to the site design where this information could be displayed if necessary.

The requirements for the project have been met, for example: unitOne Outcome 2.1 requires ongoing review of the use of tools for the project which was done and reported on in section 2.1 above.

                                Trello has been a good planning tool.  Easy to manage, changing any element or moving is very quick and easy.  If I had starting using Trello in the diligent manner I’d reached by the end of the project I would probably have had more of a benefit from it early on.
                                Visual Studio Code works really well as a source code editor.  It handles all the filetypes required for the project and works with GitHub through the terminal.  The only limitation is in my own knowledge. Researching CSS more fully initially would have made me aware of more of the capabilities of the language prior to starting to build the site.
                                GitHub - the benefits of having access to version control provided by pushing to the repository are great. The drawback of this is that, with little experience, I found it a bit of a confusing process.

                                Planning as best you can will help to improve efficiency.  Implementing the kanban planning method allows you to see all that is “on your plate” and you can see where there is most pressing need to apply yourself.  This is the entire idea behind the Trello planning boards and, unsurprisingly, when the method is correctly and fully applied, it works.  Basically utilising tools as they are intended will help deliver the most benefit to your productivity and efficiency.
Taking the time to thoroughly plan your work at the beginning gives other productivity and efficiency benefits too.  When commencing any task there is some time taken to “get your head into it”.  If you are switching between tasks regularly or going back to make alterations to a previously completed task there will regularly be time wasted getting to grips with the task at hand again.  With appropriate planning these wastages can be minimised.

                                Next time I would have a team tackle the project.  As any digital projects has different elements that can be split up and divided out amongst the team it makes for less re-up time needed for an individual to switch between task.  It can be as if individual team members are specialising in their assigned tasks.  Using this team approach means effort is more efficiently applied and the end product should be better.  Granted, there is a cost of the effort required to work collaboratively (communication, pulling work together, differences of opinion, etc) but I believe this is outweighed by the benefits of team working.

                                Testing digital solutions is best done by intended users of the solution.  If the intended user group is large and has different groups within it, a sample of testers should be used - ideally representing as many groups across a cross section of the potential users.  Different devices, OSs and browsers should also be considered if multiple versions will likely be used to access the solution.  The point of testing is to check that the solution performs as expected and functionality is not affected by any variation of user behaviour or user hardware+/software set-ups.   Testing with as wide a variety as possible of these variables will best ensure then solution doesn’t come into any unexpected compatibility problems post launch.
