                                It was the case, when IT first became affordably implementable in business, that IT’s function was to make our work life easier, faster and cheaper.  Using computers to perform tasks previously requiring large amounts of paper work (that carried with it it’s own inherent problems such as; storage, transport, security, etc) made for great efficiencies to be made in organisation of daily tasks and document storage and sharing.  With the advancement of IT, both hardware and programming development, it became possible for tasks to be performed with less and less human input, meaning; less human error, greater speed, more cost efficiencies and increased predictability.  IT, or “tech” as it is now referred to, has become more than an integrated function of most business.  It has become the medium through which business is done and in many instances it is either the product itself or the means through which the product market functions “impacting customer service, sales, and even business strategies. As a result, organisations are increasingly turning IT into a driving force in all aspects of business” (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2016/07/26/the-changing-role-of-it-in-the-future-of-business/#713a394b525d">reference#1</a>).

                                1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 
                                What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
                                
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">           
                        Digital projects are difficult to plan for and manage.  The main reason for this is that it can be hard to identify aspects of a project that are likely to be problematic and take a long time to complete before they have been attempted.  In order to overcome issues like these and successfully deliver a digital project the team must be able to be agile.  By this I mean they must be adaptable to changing circumstances and demands.  A plan with moving pieces needs people to be resilient and resourceful and not ‘give up at the first hurdle’.  Problems that arise may be unforeseen and need dealing with almost ‘on-the-fly’ so good problem-solving skills are essential as well as good listening skills.  It’s important that the design/develop/digital team listen closely to whoever the ‘client’ or intended user of the project’s end product is so that they deliver on the requirements and ensure the project lives up to expectations.  Trello, utilising the kanban planning methodology, can help with this by splitting the project up into manageable identified tasks.  This also helps with attention to detail (although attention to detail remains a required skill to be held within the team), as long as a task has been identified and placed as a card on the Trello board it can’t be forgotten about and fall through the cracks of a large project with numerous diverse demands.
                        Other skills needed include:
                        Copywriting and editing
                        Problem solving
                        Attention to detail
                        Time management
                        Adaptability/agility
                        Tech savvy - general awareness of the the wider industry/environment

                <p class = "answer">
                                A large project can feel insurmountable.  Too many demands on time with diverse requirements make knowing where to start seem a challenge in itself.  Utilising the kanban planning methodology helps with this problem by breaking down the goal into manageable, achievable tasks.  By assigning the tasks I identify to “cards” on <a href = "https://trello.com/b/a428raR1/blogproj">my Trello board</a> I will be able to pick up the ‘next task’ that needs doing and start making a dent into the overall project, one “card” at a time.

                                1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">
                                “IT projects have an unenviable reputation, with projects failing outright or at least failing to live up to expectations” (<a href = "https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/early-risk-assessment-it-projects-8973">reference#7</a>).
                                There are numerous risks that may cause a digital project to fail outright, as with any project, such as; key person dependancy (an integral team member may leave), competition (competitor innovations make your project obsolete before completion), cost risk (the initial cost estimates turn out to undershoot the actual costs which make the project unviable or loss making).
                                Digital projects carry their own specific risks which can also dramatically impact the project too.  For example developers will be working on building the program on the current iteration of the OS.  A new OS release/update could require changes to their programming to make the end product compatible with the upgrade or could even make the project untenable.
                                There is also the view of failure by not living up to expectations.  A main cause of this is a lack of buy-in from key people.  In business the main driver for an innovation can be a specific department and when cooperation is needed cross-department for the project’s success, reluctance from uncommitted directors/managers viewing the project as ‘additional work’ or a ‘vanity project’ can easily cause the project to fail to have the functionality it was designed to have.

                                1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software 
                                How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?

                <p class = "answer">
                                “According to [a] study, 63 percent of respondents frequently feel overwhelmed with the number of technologies available to run their business” (<a href = "https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-for-your-small-business">reference#4</a>), so selecting the right tech for your project may not be a clear decision to make.
                                “The main purpose of technology is to help you do what you do quicker and more efficiently” (<a href = "https://innovationmanagement.se/2018/01/11/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-for-your-startup/">reference#5</a>) so the first thing you need is to know what it is that you do? Or, what it is you are trying to do.  When you have identified the core aims of the project you are undertaking you can identify your requirements from your IT. It may be that you need something that will integrate with current systems, you may need agility to deal with changing scenarios, you might be dealing with sensitive customer information and need especially secure systems and processes.  Taking these identified requirements and marrying them up with the IT solutions that best satisfy them, as well as considering other project constraints such as budget, timescale and functionality, is how I will make the right choice in selecting technology for the job and hopefully mitigate risks that may have occurred further down the line (<a href = "https://medium.com/flowingis/choosing-the-right-technology-for-the-right-project-dda9fa27320f">reference#6</a>).

                <p class = "answer">
                                Without knowing my own skills and the capabilities of html and CSS to deliver the initial ideas I had for the website it was difficult to imagine how I could plan to complete the project.  Inputting tasks onto Trello helped me to see where I was up to and what I needed to be focussing on right now rather than worrying about what is to come.  The visualisation of the tasks as ‘cards’ on the Trello board allowed me to order the tasks according to their priority and assign due-dates (with reminders) for pivotal points (i.e. having to have all the written content complete in order to add it to the webpages).
                                “Pushing” my project over to my GitHub repository I have provided a safety net for my project in the form of version control.  If anything were to go wrong with my coding or anything else at my end (i.e. MacBook failure, files overwritten, accidental deletion, etc) I would be able to revert to any previously ‘pushed’ version of my project.  I performed a ‘git push’ at least daily to ensure sufficient version control capability (this was set as a daily Trello card).

                                1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">
                                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a piece of European Union legislation regulating the processing of personal data. Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—including name, ID numbers, locations or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                                GDPR gives users of online services (data subjects) greater control over the processing of their data than they had before GDPR was introduced. Data subjects now have a right to see what of their information is held by company and can restrict the company’s use of it, even prevent them using it altogether. Public authorities have supervisory powers and rights to impose serious sanctions for infringements of GDPR.
                                
                                For digital projects this means that data flows have to bear in mind the principle of data minimisation. The scope of collected data must be only sufficient to the requirements of the intended purposes of their processing and no more.  Similarly the data may only be retained as long as necessary, meaning time stored has to be an accessibly value assigned to data in order to delete when time limits are reached.
                                “[Failure] to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data you store and process, and suffer a data breach, you might be obliged to communicate it …to users affected by the breach. A hit like that is not the best PR and may cost you more than you could possibly imagine—both in terms of user confidence and money.” (<a href = "https://www.monterail.com/blog/introduction-to-gdpr-for-digital-companies">reference#8</a>)
