                                1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in 
                                modern business:
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">
                                It was the case, when IT first became affordably implementable in business, that IT’s function was to make our work life easier, faster and cheaper.  Using computers to perform tasks previously requiring large amounts of paper work (that carried with it it’s own inherent problems such as; storage, transport, security, etc) made for great efficiencies to be made in organisation of daily tasks and document storage and sharing.  With the advancement of IT, both hardware and programming development, it became possible for tasks to be performed with less and less human input, meaning; less human error, greater speed, more cost efficiencies and increased predictability.  IT, or “tech” as it is now referred to, has become more than an integrated function of most business.  It has become the medium through which business is done and in many instances it is either the product itself or the means through which the product market functions “impacting customer service, sales, and even business strategies. As a result, organisations are increasingly turning IT into a driving force in all aspects of business” (reference#1).

                </p><p>                A large project can feel insurmountable.  Too many demands on time with diverse requirements make knowing where to start seem a challenge in itself.  Utilising the kanban planning methodology helps with this problem by breaking down the goal into manageable, achievable tasks.  By assigning the tasks I identify to “cards” on my Trello board I will be able to pick up the ‘next task’ that needs doing and start making a dent into the overall project, one “card” at a time.

                                “The main purpose of technology is to help you do what you do quicker and more efficiently” (reference#5) so the first thing you need is to know what it is that you do? Or, what it is you are trying to do.  When you have identified the core aims of the project you are undertaking you can identify your requirements from your IT. It may be that you need something that will integrate with current systems, you may need agility to deal with changing scenarios, you might be dealing with sensitive customer information and need especially secure systems and processes.  Taking these identified requirements and marrying them up with the IT solutions that best satisfy them, as well as considering other project constraints such as budget, timescale and functionality, is how I will make the right choice in selecting technology for the job and hopefully mitigate risks that may have occurred further down the line (reference#6).
