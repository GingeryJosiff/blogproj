                        1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page

        </p>
        <p class = "answer">
              
                        My blog lands on the home page “abouMe.”.  Unit One and Unit Two have their own pages which can be navigated to from the navbar at the the top of the screen which remains in that position across all pages.  There is also a “contact.” page with phone number, email address and facebook link each identified by an icon that spread diagonally from the left hand side to the bottom-right of the content section of the page.  The icons decrease in size towards the bottom of the screen as it is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. As well as the navbar that appears on each page there is also an image of a bearded man with transparent background that floats at the top-right of the content section of each page.  The background of the site is consistent across each page are the borders and backgrounds of text boxes.  These borders and backgrounds have been chosen for there aesthetic properties and the backgrounds to the text boxes are dependant on what text is contained within them: ‘question text boxes’ have soft red stripes slanting upward from left to right while ‘answer text boxes’ have wider, softer lilac stripes slanting downward from left to right.  Pages without actual ‘questions’ and ‘answers’ still have an empty red striped ‘question text box’ at the start of the content section of the page to maintain appearance consistency across the site.

                        1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites


        </p>
        <p class = "answer">
                        Copyright law applies to websites just as it does any other product or item that has authorship. The ‘idea’ or content has an author and that author has ownership of that thing they have produced and has the right to impose copyright law on anyone who would copy it without permission.  While it is expected that web designers will harvest pieces of coding from their past work and other websites, if that code (from other peoples’ work) is used directly rather than just as inspiration for their own ideas then they will be infringing copyright.  Copyright also applies to images so, while tempting, you may not be able to use any google images you may want.  There are image providers, such as Getty Images, where you can pay for use of an image.  Whatever it is, as long as you have the owner’s permission you are fine.
                        There are other legal requirements for websites and online businesses.  Some of these are:
                        Companies Act 2006 - Websites must identify: Company name, company registration number, place of registration, registered office address, postal address, email address, how to contact the company by non-electronic means, privacy policy, cookie disclosure and a disclaimer detailing how website information can be used and what liability the company the website belongs to accepts.
                        Consumer Protection (Online and distance selling regulations, Electronic commerce regulations and the Consumer Rights Act); required information before and after an order is placed, orders must be satisfactorily fulfilled and that goods and/or services must be of satisfactory quality and as described on the website.
                        Accessibility (Equality Act 2010) - Webpages must meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, work on the most commonly used assistive technologies, include people with disabilities in user research and include and accessibility statement on the website.
                        Cyber security and meeting GDPR requirements - Websites must get SSL certification for the encryption and protection of data, website software must be regularly updated and your website should be tested for security vulnerabilities.

                        1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account 
                        Describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using 
                        webpages and how we can overcome them 
                        

        </p>
        <p class = "answer">
               
People with disabilities may have trouble accessing information on a webpage or may be prevented altogether.  For example, a blind person will not be able to read text or see images displayed on a webpage.  People may have disabilities which affect any of their following functions; Auditory, Cognitive, Neurological, Physical, Speech and Visual.  There are tools and technologies to assist in overcoming these accessibility issues which help those who suffer from a disability to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with and contribute to the Web.

                        1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites 


        </p>
        <p class = "answer">
               
*.html and *.CSS are the most common webpage filetypes and have the highest compatibility with the many browsers and OSs available to internet users.
*.html stands for “HyperText Markup Language”:
“HyperText” refers to the way the internet is navigated through hyperlinks (taking you to any specific destination on the network of the internet),
“Markup” refers to what the html language does to text within it (“marking” it as having certain properties), and
“Language” as it is a language with code-words and syntax like any other language.

*.CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets”.  They are a tool used for arranging and displaying *.html files to make websites appear as the developers design them.

Other filetypes used on the internet include; .AVI, .DOC, .GIF, .JPG, .MP3, .MPG, .MOV, .PDF, .WAV, .ZIP.
